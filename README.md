# My-projects-
This repository is a collection of my projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s designed to track my learning progress and growth as I explore front-end web development. 
My goals are:
- Practice core web technologies
- Improve code structure and styling techniques
- Experiment with interactivity and responsive design
- Document progress step-by-step

Project Structure:
- Each folder contains a single project
- Projects include source files and a brief description
- New projects will be added as I learn new concepts

What’s Next:
- Dive deeper into responsive design
- Explore modern CSS techniques (Flexbox, Grid, animations)
- Start working on small JavaScript applications
